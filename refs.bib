abstract = {We propose a concept for a Shannon-type quantification of information relevant to a decision unit or agent. The proposed measure is operational, can – at least in principle – be calculated for a given system and has an immediate interpretation as an information quantity. Its use as a natural framework for the study of sensor evolution is discussed.},
